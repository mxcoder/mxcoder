## 👋 Hey, I'm Ricardo!

I'm a longtime web developer turned engineering manager who's been tinkering with code and building things on the internet for 20+ years. I’ve bounced between frontend, backend, data engineering, machine learning, platforms, and developer experience—so I like a bit of everything!

Over the years, I've contributed to a bunch of open source projects and built plenty of things behind the scenes in private repos—sometimes as a solo builder, sometimes as part of awesome teams. Whether it's fixing bugs, adding features, or supporting others, I love being part of the community and helping cool ideas come to life.

These days, I get a kick out of helping teams grow, making dev life easier, and finding clever ways to solve problems. I’m interested in open source, automation, data, developer tooling, and anything that makes building cool stuff faster and more fun.

Some things you’ll find in my GitHub stars (and my heart):  
- Web frameworks and libraries  
- Data & ML tools  
- DX tools, CLIs, and productivity hacks  
- Platform engineering goodies  
- Neat little utilities and open source experiments

When I’m not coding or coaching, I’m probably exploring new tech, sharing ideas, or just geeking out about the future of software.
